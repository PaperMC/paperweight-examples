# ForkTest - A Paper fork, using paperweight

This is an example project, showcasing how to setup a fork of Paper (or any other fork using paperweight), using paperweight.

The files of most interest are
- build.gradle.kts
- settings.gradle.kts
- gradle.properties
- patches/server/0001-Build-changes.patch

When updating upstream, be sure to keep the dependencies noted in `build.gradle.kts` in sync with upstream.
It's also a good idea to use the same version of the Gradle wrapper as upstream.
